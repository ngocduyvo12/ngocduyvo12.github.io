            <p>My name is Ngoc Vo, I have a bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering at University of Colorado Denver.
                I initially started out as a Bioengineering major, but as a new immigrant with limited
                understanding of English, it proved to be quite a challenge. Between that and knowing the fact that I
                enjoy solving analytical problems finally convinced me to change my major. And I have to say it is
                probably one of best decision I have made in my life. I really enjoyed learning about all aspect of
                mechanical engineering.</p>
            <p>
                During my senior year, I was able to get an internship with AMP robotic as an intern engineer. After my
                graduation, they offered me a job right away as a robotic technician. I though it would be a great
                chance for me to get out on to the field and apply what I have learned in a real-world environment.
                Worked started out fine and I learned a lot of useful technique, and I get to travel a lot. But after a
                while, I wanted to spend more time with my family and my current position does not allow me to do so.
                Coding has always been a passion of mine, during my time as a student, I would often spend time teaching
                myself python for my senior design project. And I find myself liking coding more and more. So
                I started to get into coding and I was lucky to be able to get into University of Denverâ€™s full-stack
                coding bootcamp. </p>
