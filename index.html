            <p>
                My name is Ngoc Vo, and I have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at University of Colorado, Denver.
                I initially started as a Biology major, but I soon discovered that I always have a fascination with technology and robot. Becoming aware of the fact that I
                enjoy solving analytical problems, finally convinced me to change my major. I believe it was
                probably one of best decision I have made in my life. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about all aspect of
                mechanical engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                After nearing the end of my academics, I started an internship with AMP robotic as an intern engineer. They offered me a job right away as a robotic technician. I though it would be an excellent
                chance for me to get out in the field and apply apply my proficiency in real-world environments.
                I learned a lot of useful techniques, and I was able travel a lot. After a
                while, I wanted to spend more time with my family and focus on learning development techniques further.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coding has always been a passion of mine. During my time as a student, I would often spend hours teaching
                myself python for my senior design project. I found myself favoring coding more and more. So
                I switched gears, I was lucky to be able to get into University of Denverâ€™s full-stack
                coding bootcamp, which leveled my skills further and advanced my learning.
