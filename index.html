            <p>My name is Ngoc Duy Vo, I was born on September 2nd 1994 on a country known as Viet Nam. Me and my family
                moved to the state back in 2007 when I was still in 8th grade. We have had hard times here and there but
                I persevered and was able to finish my education.</p>
            <p>I finished my bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering at University of Colorado Denver with a rough
                beginning. I initially started out as a Bioengineering major, but as a new immigrant with limited
                understanding of English, it proved to be quite a challenge. Between that and knowing the fact that I
                enjoy solving analytical problems finally convinced me to change my major. And I have to say it is
                probably one of best decision I have made in my life. After changing my major, I feel like a huge burden
                have been lifted. My grade increases by leaps and bounds, although still not at the point where I want
                myself to be mainly because of my initial beginning. The classes felt easier and I enjoyed school a lot
                more.</p>
            <p>
                During my senior year, I was able to get an internship with AMP robotic as an intern engineer. After my
                graduation, they offered me a job right away as a robotic technician. I though it would be a great
                chance for me to get out on to the field and apply what I have learned in a real-world environment.
                Worked started out fine and I learned a lot of useful technique, and I get to travel a lot. But after a
                while, I wanted to spend more time with my family and my current position does not allow me to do so. So
                I started to get into coding and I was lucky to be able to get into University of Denverâ€™s full-stack
                coding bootcamp. </p>
